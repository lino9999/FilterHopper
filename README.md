FilterHopper is a lightweight plugin that adds a special filtering hopper to your Minecraft server. Unlike regular hoppers that accept all items, Filter Hoppers only allow specific items to pass through while completely destroying any unwanted items.

Features
Custom Filter Hopper - A special hopper that filters incoming items
Item Destruction - Items not in the filter list are instantly destroyed, not just blocked
Easy GUI Interface - Right-click to open a 9-slot filter configuration menu
Named Item Support - Filters can distinguish between regular items and items with custom names
Simple Commands - Just one command to obtain Filter Hoppers
How It Works
